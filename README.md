### What is SysTray?
![SysTray Animated](assets/SysTray.gif)<br>
Systray is a little application that runs in the Windows system tray, and provides you with some helpful information about the state of your machine.

**No spyware.  No keyloggers.  No cryptomining.  No malware.  No adware.  No evil supervillians.**

Just a simple application to add some functionality to your Windows computer.
