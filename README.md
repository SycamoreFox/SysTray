### What is SysTray?
![SysTray Animated](assets/SysTray.gif)<br>
Systray is a little application that runs in Windows system tray, and provides you with some helpful information about the state of your machine:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disc read/write activity
- Caps Lock key state
- Num Lock key state

### Why SysTray?
Many Windows users want to know at a glance how much memory is being used? / are the disk drives in use? / is my Caps lock key on? / etc.

Windows does not come with such functionality 'out of the box' - thus SysTray

### How much does it cost?
SysTray is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).  It's yours to use freely.
