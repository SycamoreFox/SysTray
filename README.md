### What is SysTray?
![SysTray Animated](assets/SysTray.gif)<br>
Systray is a little application that runs in Windows system tray, and provides you with some helpful information about the state of your machine:
- CPU-Processor usage
- RAM-Memory usage
- Disc drive(s) read/write activity
- Caps Lock key state
- Num Lock key state

### Why SysTray?
Many Windows users want to know at a glance how their computer is performing.  Windows does not come with such functionality 'out of the box' - thus SysTray

### How much does it cost?
SysTray is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).  It's yours to use freely.  I hope you find it useful and enjoyable.

**No spyware.  No keyloggers.  No cryptomining.  No malware.  No adware.  No evil supervillians.**

Just a simple application to add some functionality to your Windows computer.
